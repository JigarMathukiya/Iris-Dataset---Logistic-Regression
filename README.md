# Iris-Dataset---Logistic-Regression

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Data set :
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length , Petal Width , Sepal Length , Sepal width and Class.

There are two file iris.py file have trained though from 150 records 1 to 130 is training dataset rest of them is testing dataset. and another file iris_random.py trained throgh random function that split randomaly 112 record as training dataset or other are testing dataset.
